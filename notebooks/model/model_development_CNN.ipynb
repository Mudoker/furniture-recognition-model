    "In this notebook, we will focus on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This process will involve training the CNN model on preprocessed image data and optimizing its performance through hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, we will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training:** We will train the selected CNN model using the preprocessed image data. This involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will explore different combinations of hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our CNN model. This may include tuning parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation:** After training and tuning the CNN model, we will evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step will help us assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and determine its effectiveness in predicting labels for new images in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have developed a well-trained CNN model and evaluated its performance, providing insights into its effectiveness for image recognition tasks. This model will serve as a foundation for further analysis and applications in image classification."

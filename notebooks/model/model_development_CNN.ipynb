    "In this notebook, we will focus on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This process will involve training the CNN model on preprocessed image data and optimizing its performance through hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, we will perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training:** We will train the selected CNN model using the preprocessed image data. This involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will explore different combinations of hyperparameters to optimize the performance of our CNN model. This may include tuning parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have developed a well-trained CNN model capable of accurately predicting labels for new images in the dataset. This model will serve as a foundation for further analysis and applications in image recognition tasks."

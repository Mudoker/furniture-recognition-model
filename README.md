# COSC 2753 - Machine Learning

## _Furniture Detection and Classification_

This project endeavors to construct a machine learning model capable of identifying furniture items and categorizing them into respective types based on image analysis. By scrutinizing diverse features and attributes of furniture pieces, the model can discern patterns distinguishing between various categories like chairs, tables, sofas, etc., and further subdivide them into specific types within each category.

### Project Setup Guide

This guide delineates the essential steps to establish the project structure for efficient management of datasets and notebooks. Additionally, it's crucial to note that alterations in file locations may lead to improper library imports.

Since the dataset exceeds the upload limit of GitHub, it is housed in a OneDrive folder. Please procure the dataset from the provided link:

[Dataset](https://rmiteduau-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bao_nguyenthien_rmit_edu_vn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fbao_nguyenthien_rmit_edu_vn%2FDocuments%2FFurniture_Data%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fbao_nguyenthien_rmit_edu_vn%2FDocuments&ga=1)

Once the dataset is obtained, extract the files and deposit them into the `data/raw` folder. Ensure not to alter the name of the zip file.

# COSC 2753 - Machine Learning

## _Furniture Detection and Classification_

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect furniture items and classify them into corresponding categories and types based on images. By analyzing various features and characteristics of furniture pieces, the model can learn patterns that differentiate between different categories such as chairs, tables, sofas, etc., and further classify them into specific types within each category.
